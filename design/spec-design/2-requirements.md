# Spec Process — Requirements

## Context

Team of 3–4 people:

- Christoph, Product Owner / Design
- Nicolas, Architect
- David, Frontend
- Mike, Marketing / Teaching

We use Claude Code heavily. It writes a lot of the code already, and we want to push that further. The team focuses on direction, architecture, and quality.

## What the process must achieve

1. Fast turnover. Ideas ship quickly, process doesn't slow things down.
2. Fast experimentation. Cheap to try, cheap to throw away.
3. Short code reviews. AI-generated code is too voluminous to review line-by-line. Review the spec, not the code.
4. Real discussions on architecture, UX, trade-offs. Not rubber-stamping a PR.
5. Deliberate architecture. Decisions happen on purpose, not as side-effects of whatever got built first.
6. Written records. The "why" and "what" outlive the conversation they came from.

## What it must not be

- Bureaucratic. Small things stay lightweight.
- Slow. The process should make us faster, not add gates.
- Complex. If you can't remember the steps, you won't follow them.
- Anti-experimentation. Prototyping is fine. Just write down the reasoning before committing to a direction.

## The core tension

We want speed and deliberation. Claude generates solutions instantly, which tempts you to skip thinking. The process needs to make "think first" feel easier than "build first".
